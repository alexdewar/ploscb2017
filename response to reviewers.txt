Reviewer #1:
All minor corrections done.

[What about major comment re "complex scenes"?]

Reviewer #2:
1. There appears to be some confusion here. We are modelling the data in Seelig and Jayaraman's 2013 paper, which looked at the visual receptive fields of ring neurons cf. their 2015 paper which looked at PI (both in Nature).
2. Seelig and Jayaraman veried the RFs with the standard white noise stimuli technique (their refs 37,41). This is now mentioned in Materials and methods.

3.
(5) We're really looking at pattern discrimination here, not place recognition
(6) Link to Horridge + active vision + [something else]
(7) The data for the "extra RF" simulations were added to Fig. 2 and mentioned in the text

"Specific comments":
p4 - [justify use of average filters]
p6 - other difference metrics exist: abs diff, kullback-leibler, bayesian information criterion, etc.
p13 - corrected
p14 - [get original data from S&J - do this?]
