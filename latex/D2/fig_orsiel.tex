\caption{Can a neural network be trained to simultaneously discriminate visual stimuli on the basis of orientation, size or elevation?
A--C: Network activation for a range of orientations, sizes and elevations. The colour of the line indicates which of the four types of input were used: raw views, R2 neurons, R4d neurons or R2 an R4d neurons. The error bars show standard error.
D--F: Mutual information between stimuli and responses, $I(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{R})$, for different orientations, sizes or elevations, with each bar representing a different type of input to the network.}
