\caption{The experimental paradigm for testing pattern recognition in flies on which our simulation is based.
A: The fly is held tethered in a drum. As the fly attempts to rotate about its yaw-axis, the drum rotates in the opposite direction, thus allowing the fly to select the portion of the pattern in view. After \protect\cite{Ernst1999}.
B and C: The \ac{rms} difference in activation for R2 and R4d neurons (blue and green lines, respectively) as the pattern is rotated. Notice that there is a much smaller difference in activation when the triangles are aligned about the vertical centre of mass (C) than not (B); this is mirrored in real flies performance on this task \protect\cite{Ernst1999}.}
