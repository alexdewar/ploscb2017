  Abstract                 = {The neural circuits that mediate behavioral choice
 evaluate and integrate information from the
 environment with internal demands and then initiate a
 behavioral response. Even circuits that support
 simple decisions remain poorly understood. In
 Drosophila mela-nogaster, oviposition on a substrate
 containing ethanol enhances fitness; however, little
 is known about the neural mechanisms me-diating this
 important choice behavior. Here, we characterize the
 neural modulation of this simple choice and show that
 distinct subsets of dopaminergic neurons compete to
 either enhance or in-hibit egg-laying preference for
 ethanol-containing food. Moreover, activity in
 $\alpha$$\prime$$\beta$$\prime$ neurons of the mushroom body
 and a subset of ellipsoid body ring neurons (R2) is
 required for this choice. We propose a model where
 competing dopaminergic systems modu-late oviposition
 preference to adjust to changes in natural
 ovipo-sition substrates.},

  Abstract                 = {Honeybees have small brains, but their behavioural
 repertoire is impressive. In this article we focus on
 the extent to which adaptive behaviour in honeybees
 exceeds elementary forms of learning. We use the
 concept of modularity of cognitive functions to
 characterize levels of complexity in the honeybee
 brain. We show that behavioural complexity in the
 honeybee cannot be explained by independent functions
 of vertically arranged, domain-specific processing
 modules, but requires horizontal integration in a
 central state, and we identify neural mechanisms that
 may underlie domain-specific processing and central
 integration. The honeybee may serve as a useful model
 for the study of intermediate levels of complexity in
 cognitive functions and the search for their neural
 substrates.},

  Abstract                 = {Many animals navigate using a combination of visual
 landmarks and path integration. In mammalian brains,
 head direction cells integrate these two streams of
 information by representing an animal's heading
 relative to landmarks, yet maintaining their
 directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion
 cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in
 head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball
 in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that
 landmark-based orientation and angular path
 integration are combined in the population responses
 of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a
 toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain.
 The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth
 relative to its environment, tracking visual
 landmarks when available and relying on self-motion
 cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion
 cues are absent, a representation of the animal's
 orientation is maintained in this network through
 persistent activity, a potential substrate for
 short-term memory. Several features of the population
 dynamics of these neurons and their circular
 anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring
 attractors, network structures that have been
 proposed to support the function of navigational
 brain circuits.},

  abstract = {The ability of honeybees (Apis mellifera) to
 discriminate pattern orientation was evaluated by
 examining their choice behaviour in a twin-choice
 Y-maze apparatus which offered two differently
 oriented patterns, one of which was associated with a
 reward. The distinctive feature of this experimental
 arrangement was that it forced the freely flying bees
 to choose between the two patterns at a distance,
 thus preventing the bees from fixating the patterns
 and discriminating between them on the basis of an
 eidetic (`photographic') image. Training and testing
 experiments using a number of different pairs of
 patterns, such as gratings, stripes and plaids, led
 to the following results: (i) bees perform well at
 discriminating the orientation of unidirectional
 patterns, such as single stripes or gratings; (ii)
 trained bees learn to prefer the orientation that is
 associated with the reward, as well as to avoid the
 unrewarded orientation; (iii) bees perform poorly at
 discriminating the orientation of right-angled
 crosses or plaids, but well at discriminating the
 orientation of 45 degrees crosses or plaids; and (iv)
 orientation discrimination appears to be mediated
 primarily by signals from the green-receptor channel
 of the bee's visual system. These findings, together
 with recent work (Srinivasan et al. Nature, Lond.
 362, 539-540 (1993)), suggest that the honeybee's
 visual system analyses orientation in much the same
 manner as the mammalian cortex. Our data suggest the
 participation of at least three orientation-sensitive
 channels with different preferred orientations, and
 broad tuning curves with half-widths of ca. 90
 degrees.},

 spatial orientation in total darkness, conditioned
 courtship suppression by mated females, and nine
 different examples of visual learning. The latter
 used the reinforcers of heat, visual oscillations,
 mechanical shaking, or sucrose, and as conditioned
 stimuli, color, intensity contrast, as well as
 stationary and moving visual patterns. No forms of
 consolidated memory have been tested in mushroom
 body-less flies. With respect to short-term memory
 the mushroom bodies of Drosophila are specially
 required for chemosensory learning tasks, but not for
 associative learning and memory in general.},

However, a neural-circuit architecture for computing heading has not been experimentally defined in any species. Here we describe a set of clockwise- and anticlockwise-shifting neurons in the Drosophila central complex whose wiring and physiology provide a means to rotate an angular heading estimate based on the fly's angular velocity. We show that each class of shifting neurons exists in two subtypes, with spatiotemporal activity profiles that suggest different roles for each subtype at the start and end of tethered-walking turns. Shifting neurons are required for the heading system to properly track the fly's heading in the dark, and stimulation of these neurons induces predictable shifts in the heading signal. The central features of this biological circuit are analogous to those of computational models proposed for head-direction cells in rodents and may shed light on how neural systems, in general, perform integration.},

Such a compass representation was recently discovered in a neural population in the Drosophila melanogaster central complex, a brain region implicated in spatial navigation. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology in head-fixed walking flies to identify a different neural population that conjunctively encodes heading and angular velocity, and is excited selectively by turns in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. We show how these mirror-symmetric turn responses combine with the neurons' connectivity to the compass neurons to create an elegant mechanism for updating the fly's heading representation when the animal turns in darkness. This mechanism, which employs recurrent loops with an angular shift, bears a resemblance to those proposed in theoretical models for rodent head direction cells. Our results provide a striking example of structure matching function for a broadly relevant computation.},

Thirty years ago, a group of population geneticists performed a series of mark-and-recapture experiments on Drosophila flies, which demonstrated that even cosmopolitan species are capable of covering 10 km of open desert, probably in just a few hours and without the possibility of feeding along the way. In this review I revisit these fascinating and informative experiments and attempt to explain how-from takeoff to landing-the flies might have made these journeys based on our current knowledge of flight behavior. This exercise provides insight into how animals generate long behavioral sequences using sensory-motor modules that may have an ancient evolutionary origin.},

For the discrimination of large colour distances bees made relatively fast decisions and selected target colours with a high degree of accuracy, but for the discrimination of smaller colour distances the accuracy decreased and the bees response times to find correct flowers significantly increased. For small colour distances there was also significant linear correlations between accuracy and response time for the individual bees.
