  abstract =      {Many animals navigate using a combination of visual
                   landmarks and path integration. In mammalian brains,
                   head direction cells integrate these two streams of
                   information by representing an animal's heading
                   relative to landmarks, yet maintaining their
                   directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion
                   cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in
                   head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball
                   in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that
                   landmark-based orientation and angular path
                   integration are combined in the population responses
                   of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a
                   toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain.
                   The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth
                   relative to its environment, tracking visual
                   landmarks when available and relying on self-motion
                   cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion
                   cues are absent, a representation of the animal's
                   orientation is maintained in this network through
                   persistent activity, a potential substrate for
                   short-term memory. Several features of the population
                   dynamics of these neurons and their circular
                   anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring
                   attractors, network structures that have been
                   proposed to support the function of navigational
                   brain circuits.},

  abstract =      {The ability of honeybees (Apis mellifera) to
                   discriminate pattern orientation was evaluated by
                   examining their choice behaviour in a twin-choice
                   Y-maze apparatus which offered two differently
                   oriented patterns, one of which was associated with a
                   reward. The distinctive feature of this experimental
                   arrangement was that it forced the freely flying bees
                   to choose between the two patterns at a distance,
                   thus preventing the bees from fixating the patterns
                   and discriminating between them on the basis of an
                   eidetic (`photographic') image. Training and testing
                   experiments using a number of different pairs of
                   patterns, such as gratings, stripes and plaids, led
                   to the following results: (i) bees perform well at
                   discriminating the orientation of unidirectional
                   patterns, such as single stripes or gratings; (ii)
                   trained bees learn to prefer the orientation that is
                   associated with the reward, as well as to avoid the
                   unrewarded orientation; (iii) bees perform poorly at
                   discriminating the orientation of right-angled
                   crosses or plaids, but well at discriminating the
                   orientation of 45 degrees crosses or plaids; and (iv)
                   orientation discrimination appears to be mediated
                   primarily by signals from the green-receptor channel
                   of the bee's visual system. These findings, together
                   with recent work (Srinivasan et al. Nature, Lond.
                   362, 539-540 (1993)), suggest that the honeybee's
                   visual system analyses orientation in much the same
                   manner as the mammalian cortex. Our data suggest the
                   participation of at least three orientation-sensitive
                   channels with different preferred orientations, and
                   broad tuning curves with half-widths of ca. 90
                   degrees.},

                   chemosensory cues as conditioned stimuli have flies
                   been found to be compromised by a block in the
                   mushroom body pathway. Among the learning tasks not
                   requiring these structures are a case of motor
                   learning (yaw torque/heat), a test of the fly’s
                   spatial orientation in total darkness, conditioned
                   courtship suppression by mated females, and nine
                   different examples of visual learning. The latter
                   used the reinforcers of heat, visual oscillations,
                   mechanical shaking, or sucrose, and as conditioned
                   stimuli, color, intensity contrast, as well as
                   stationary and moving visual patterns. No forms of
                   consolidated memory have been tested in mushroom
                   body-less flies. With respect to short-term memory
                   the mushroom bodies of Drosophila are specially
                   required for chemosensory learning tasks, but not for

  abstract =      {Honeybees have small brains, but their behavioural
                   repertoire is impressive. In this article we focus on
                   the extent to which adaptive behaviour in honeybees
                   exceeds elementary forms of learning. We use the
                   concept of modularity of cognitive functions to
                   characterize levels of complexity in the honeybee
                   brain. We show that behavioural complexity in the
                   honeybee cannot be explained by independent functions
                   of vertically arranged, domain-specific processing
                   modules, but requires horizontal integration in a
                   central state, and we identify neural mechanisms that
                   may underlie domain-specific processing and central
                   integration. The honeybee may serve as a useful model
                   for the study of intermediate levels of complexity in
                   cognitive functions and the search for their neural

                   evaluate and integrate information from the
                   environment with internal demands and then initiate a
                   behavioral response. Even circuits that support
                   simple decisions remain poorly understood. In
                   Drosophila mela-nogaster, oviposition on a substrate
                   containing ethanol enhances fitness; however, little
                   is known about the neural mechanisms me-diating this
                   important choice behavior. Here, we characterize the
                   neural modulation of this simple choice and show that
                   distinct subsets of dopaminergic neurons compete to
                   either enhance or in-hibit egg-laying preference for
                   ethanol-containing food. Moreover, activity in
                   $\alpha$′$\beta$′ neurons of the mushroom body
                   and a subset of ellipsoid body ring neurons (R2) is
                   required for this choice. We propose a model where
                   competing dopaminergic systems modu-late oviposition
                   preference to adjust to changes in natural
                   ovipo-sition substrates.},
