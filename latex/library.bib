Some studies have suggested that bees remember only isolated features such as spatial frequency and line angles, rather than the photographic search images that are characteristic of vertebrates.

  Abstract                 = {Visual memories of landmarks play a major role in guiding the habitual foraging routes of ants and bees, buthowthesememories engage visuo-motor control systems during guidance is poorly understood. We approach this problem through a study of image matching, a navigational strategy in which insects reach a familiar place by moving so that their current retinal image transforms to match a memorized snapshot of the scene viewed from that place. Analysis of how navigating wood ants correct their course when close to a goal reveals a significant part of the mechanism under- lying this transformation. Ants followed a short route to an inconspicuous feeder positioned at a fixed distance from a vertical luminance edge. They responded to an unexpected jump of the edge by turning to face the new feeder position specified by the edge. Importantly, the initial speed of the turn increased linearly with the turn’s amplitude. This correlation implies that the ants’ turns are driven initially by their prior calculation of the angular difference between the current retinal position of the edge and its desired position in their memorized view. Similar turns keep ants to their path during unperturbed routes. The neural circuitry mediating image-matching is thus concerned not only with the storage of views, but also with making exact comparisons between the retinal positions of a visual feature in a memorized view and of the same feature in the current retinal image.},

In this article we focus on the extent to which adaptive behaviour in honeybees exceeds elementary forms of learning. We use the concept of modularity of cognitive functions to characterize levels of complexity in the honeybee brain. We show that behavioural complexity in the honeybee cannot be explained by independent functions of vertically arranged, domain-specific processing modules, but requires horizontal integration in a central state, and we identify neural mechanisms that may underlie domain-specific processing and central integration. The honeybee may serve as a useful model for the study of intermediate levels of complexity in cognitive functions and the search for their neural substrates. },

Ongoing research seeks to help us understand how these behaviours are controlled in natural complex environments. A necessary complement to behavioural studies is an understanding of the sensory ecology within which an animal behaves. To this end we have analysed ants'-perspective views of a habitat within which desert ant navigation is well studied. Results from our analysis suggest that: parsimonious visual strategies for homing and route guidance are effective over behaviourally useful distances even in cluttered environments; that these strategies can function effectively using only the skyline heights as input; and that the simplicity and efficacy of using stored views as a visual compass makes it a viable and robust mechanism for route guidance.},

  Abstract                 = {Many animals navigate using a combination of visual
 landmarks and path integration. In mammalian brains,
 head direction cells integrate these two streams of
 information by representing an animal's heading
 relative to landmarks, yet maintaining their
 directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion
 cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in
 head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball
 in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that
 landmark-based orientation and angular path
 integration are combined in the population responses
 of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a
 toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain.
 The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth
 relative to its environment, tracking visual
 landmarks when available and relying on self-motion
 cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion
 cues are absent, a representation of the animal's
 orientation is maintained in this network through
 persistent activity, a potential substrate for
 short-term memory. Several features of the population
 dynamics of these neurons and their circular
 anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring
 attractors, network structures that have been
 proposed to support the function of navigational
 brain circuits.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability of honeybees (Apis mellifera) to discriminate pattern orientation was evaluated by examining their choice behaviour in a twin-choice Y-maze apparatus which offered two differently oriented patterns, one of which was associated with a reward. The distinctive feature of this experimental arrangement was that it forced the freely flying bees to choose between the two patterns at a distance, thus preventing the bees from fixating the patterns and discriminating between them on the basis of an eidetic (`photographic') image. Training and testing experiments using a number of different pairs of patterns, such as gratings, stripes and plaids, led to the following results: (i) bees perform well at discriminating the orientation of unidirectional patterns, such as single stripes or gratings; (ii) trained bees learn to prefer the orientation that is associated with the reward, as well as to avoid the unrewarded orientation; (iii) bees perform poorly at discriminating the orientation of right-angled crosses or plaids, but well at discriminating the orientation of 45 degrees crosses or plaids; and (iv) orientation discrimination appears to be mediated primarily by signals from the green-receptor channel of the bee's visual system. These findings, together with recent work (Srinivasan et al. Nature, Lond. 362, 539-540 (1993)), suggest that the honeybee's visual system analyses orientation in much the same manner as the mammalian cortex. Our data suggest the participation of at least three orientation-sensitive channels with different preferred orientations, and broad tuning curves with half-widths of ca. 90 degrees.},

  Abstract                 = {A total of 18 associative learning/memory tests have been applied to Drosophila melanogaster flies lacking mushroom bodies. Only in paradigms involving chemosensory cues as conditioned stimuli have flies been found to be compromised by a block in the mushroom body pathway. Among the learning tasks not requiring these structures are a case of motor learning (yaw torque/heat), a test of the fly’s spatial orientation in total darkness, conditioned courtship suppression by mated females, and nine different examples of visual learning. The latter used the reinforcers of heat, visual oscillations, mechanical shaking, or sucrose, and as conditioned stimuli, color, intensity contrast, as well as stationary and moving visual patterns. No forms of consolidated memory have been tested in mushroom body-less flies. With respect to short-term memory the mushroom bodies of Drosophila are specially required for chemosensory learning tasks, but not for associative learning and memory in general.},

  Abstract                 = {When tested in rectangular arenas, the navigational behavior of the ant Gigantiops destructor can produce results similar to vertebrates. Such results are usually interpreted as supporting the ability of animals to segregate spatial geometry and features. Here, we combine a detailed analysis of ants' paths with panoramic images taken from the ant's perspective that can serve as a basis for developing view-based matching models. The corner choices observed in ants were better predicted by the use of panoramic views along with a simple matching process rotational image difference function (rIDF)] than by models assuming segregation of geometry and features (G/F). Our view-based matching model could also explain some aspects of the ants' path (i.e., initial direction, length) resulting from the different visual conditions, suggesting that ants were using such a taxon-like strategy. Analyzed at the individual level, the results show that ants' idiosyncratic paths tend to evolve gradually from trial to trial, revealing that the ants were partially updating their route memory after each trial. This study illustrates the remarkable flexibilities that can arise from the use of taxon-like strategies and stresses the importance of considering them in vertebrates.

  Abstract                 = {Ants can use visual information to guide long idiosyncratic routes and accurately pinpoint locations in complex natural environments. It has often been assumed that the world knowledge of these foragers consists of multiple discrete views that are retrieved sequentially for breaking routes into sections controlling approaches to a goal. Here we challenge this idea by using a model of visual navigation that does not store and use discrete views to replicate the results from paradigmatic experiments which have been taken as evidence that ants navigate using such discrete snapshots. Instead of sequentially retrieving views, the proposed architecture gathers information from all experienced views into a single memory network, and uses this network to determine the most familiar heading at a given location. This algorithm is consistent with the navigation of ants in both laboratory and natural environments, and provides a parsimonious solution to deal with visual information from multiple locations.},

  Abstract                 = {We took panoramic snapshots in outdoor scenes at regular intervals in two- or three-dimensional grids covering 1 m2 or 1 m3 and determined how the root mean square pixel differences between each of the images and a reference image acquired at one of the locations in the grid develop over distance from the reference position. We then asked whether the reference position can be pinpointed from a random starting position by moving the panoramic imaging device in such a way that the image differences relative to the reference image are minimized. We find that on time scales of minutes to hours, outdoor locations are accurately defined by a clear, sharp minimum in a smooth three-dimensional (3D) volume of image differences (the 3D difference function). 3D difference functions depend on the spatial-frequency content of natural scenes and on the spatial layout of objects therein. They become steeper in the vicinity of dominant objects. Their shape and smoothness, however, are affected by changes in illumination and shadows. The difference functions generated by rotation are similar in shape to those generated by translation, but their plateau values are higher. Rotational difference functions change little with distance from the reference location. Simple gradient descent methods are surprisingly successful in recovering a goal location, even if faced with transient changes in illumination. Our results show that view-based homing with panoramic images is in principle feasible in natural environments and does not require the identification of individual landmarks. We discuss the relevance of our findings to the study of robot and insect homing.},
