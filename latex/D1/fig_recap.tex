\caption{What can population activity for R2 and R4d neurons be `used' for?
A--B: Mean activation of R4d neurons on presentation of a bar at different azimuths (solid line: left-hand neurons; dashed line: right-hand neurons).
C--F: \acp{RIDF} for different patterns \protect\cite<from>{Ernst1999}, for R2 (blue lines) and R4d neurons (green lines). Of these patterns, only that shown in F has been shown to be not discriminable by flies \protect\cite{Ernst1999}; note that the minima in F at $\pm 90\degree$ are lower than those in C--E, indicating that this pattern is less discriminable by the population of \acp{RF}. The dashed lines indicate the midline.}
