\caption{Outputs of simulated R2 cells for published pattern pairs. Whether a pattern pair is discriminable by flies can be predicted partly on the basis of the difference in R2 activity.
The patterns tested here are drawn from \protect\cite{Ernst1999} and are grouped together according to the figures in which they appear in that work.
The corresponding figure numbers are shown in parentheses.
All patterns for which the significance of `spontaneous preference' ($\overline{\mathrm{SPP}}$) was given are included.
Grey bars indicate that the $\overline{\mathrm{SPP}}$ for the pattern was significant ($p<.05$).
A higher score indicates a greater \ac{rms} difference in R2 activity and thus that the pattern was more discriminable by the simulation.
In general, within these groups, the patterns where there was a significant spontaneous preference (in \protect\cite{Ernst1999}) have a greater difference in activity.
[Should we do a correlation here?]
Performance on more `horizontal' patterns (e.g. \emph{(3)} and the final three patterns in \emph{(12)}) was poor in the behavioural experiments, but better in simulation.
This is perhaps due to the horizontal motion of the patterns in training, as noted in \protect\cite{Ernst1999}.
