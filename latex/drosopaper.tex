\section*{Abstract}
All organisms wishing to survive and reproduce must be able to respond adaptively to a complex, changing world. Yet the computational power available is constrained by biology and evolution, favouring mechanisms that are parsimonious yet robust. Here we investigate the information carried in small populations of visually responsive neurons in \emph{Drosophila melanogaster}. These so-called `ring neurons', projecting to the ellipsoid body of the central complex, are reported to be necessary for complex visual tasks such as pattern recognition and visual navigation. Recently the receptive fields of these neurons have been mapped, allowing us to investigate how well they can support such behaviours. For instance, in a simulation of classic pattern discrimination experiments, we show that the patterns of output from the ring neurons matches observed fly behaviour. However, performance of the neurons (like flies) is not perfect and can be easily improved by addition of extra neurons, suggesting the neuron's receptive fields are not optimised for recognising abstract shapes, a conclusion which casts doubt on cognitive explanations of fly behaviour in pattern recognition assays. Using artificial neural networks, we then assess how easy it is to decode more general information about stimulus shape from the ring neuron population codes. We show that these neurons are well-suited for encoding information about size, position and orientation, which are more relevant behavioural parameters for a fly than abstract pattern properties. This leads us to suggest that in order to understand the properties of neural systems, one must consider how perceptual circuits put information at the service of behaviour.

\section*{Author Summary}
{\bf moved from old Summary section}
We have given here a novel insight into the functions and organisation of the \emph{Drosophila} visual system, and additionally raised issues regarding neural coding in insects more generally. In particular, we challenge the idea that a complex behaviour must be supported by a discrete cognitive module to extract abstract features or properties of stimuli. \emph{Drosophila}’s limited ability to discriminate patterns using abstract properties seems to be the by-product of a simple visual system tuned to provide information to guide specific behaviours. In the future, a combined approach – behavioural research that incorporates insights and predictions from computational models – could help pave the way to a mechanistic, quantitative account of insect behaviour and its relation to sensory information.

\section*{Introduction}
As with many animals, vision plays a key role in a number of behaviours performed by the fruit fly \emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, including mate-recognition \cite{Agrawal2014}, place homing \cite{Ofstad2011}, visual course control \cite{Borst2014}, collision-avoidance \cite{Tammero2002}, landing \cite{Tammero2002} and escaping a looming object (like a rolled newspaper, for example) \cite{Card2008}. The benefit of studying these visually guided behaviours in \emph{Drosophila} is the range of neurogenetic techniques which give a realistic chance of understanding the neural circuits that underpin them. With that goal in mind, we focus on recent work \cite{Seelig2013} which mapped the receptive fields of a set of visually responsive neurons, the ring neurons of the ellipsoid body. These neurons are surprisingly small in number given that they are necessary and sufficient for certain complex behaviours, such as short term spatial memory, pattern discrimination or place memory \cite{Ofstad2011,Liu2006,Neuser2008,Seelig2015}. To understand their role in these behaviours, we used modelling to bridge the gap between neurogenetic data and behaviour by evaluating neural responses during simulations of fly experiments. In this way we investigate how small populations of visual neurons in \emph{Drosophila}, which might represent a sensory bottleneck, can still provide behaviourally relevant information.

In laboratory assays flies show interesting spontaneous visual behaviours. For instance, flies will orient towards bar stimuli \cite{Reichardt1969,Gotz1987} and in a circular arena with two diametrically placed bars will walk between them for long periods. This spontaneous preference for elongated vertical bars is reduced as the bar is shortened until free-flying flies show a spontaneous aversion to small cube stimuli \cite{Maimon2008}. In addition a number of studies have investigated the process of pattern recognition and its neural underpinnings \cite{Ernst1999,Liu2006,Pan2009}. The standard paradigm involves putting a fly into a closed-loop system where it is tethered inside a drum, on the inside of which are two different visual patterns, alternating every 90\degree, giving four visual stimuli in total (see Figure~\ref{fig:recap}E). As the fly attempts to rotate in one direction, the drum counter-rotates in closed loop, giving the illusion of the fly moving in a stable world. To elicit conditioned behaviour, if the fly faces one of the four pattern stimuli it is punished by a heat beam. Over time if the fly is able to differentiate the patterns it will preferentially face the unpunished pattern. This procedure has been used to demonstrate that flies can differentiate stimulus pairs such as upright and inverted `T' shapes, a small and a large square, and many others \cite{Ernst1999}. That is, flies seem to possess a form of pattern recognition and pattern memory analogous to the better-studied pattern memory of bees \cite{vonFrisch1914,Giurfa1997,Horridge2009}. Interestingly, both bees \cite{Srinivasan1994} and flies \cite{Ernst1999} fail systematically to discriminate certain pattern pairs. 

The control of these visual behaviours is dependent on the central complex of flies, a brain area thought to be involved primarily in spatial representation,action selection and mediation between visual input and motor output \cite{Pfeiffer2014}. The central complex comprises the ellipsoid body, the fan-shaped body, the paired noduli and the protocerebral bridge \cite{Young2010}. A particular class of neurons that project to the ellipsoid body of the central complex are `ring neurons', which are known to be involved in visual behaviours (R1: place homing \cite{Sitaraman2008,Sitaraman2010,Ofstad2011}; R2/R4m: pattern recognition \cite{Ernst1999,Liu2006,Pan2009}; R3/R4: bar fixation memory \cite{Neuser2008}). Here we investigate how the ring neurons might contribute to these behaviours, by simulating the visual input as it would be processed through this small population of visually responsive cells. In particular, we can address why flies might be unable to discriminate certain pattern pairs, whether these subpopulations of neurons are optimised for pattern recognition and, if not, what visually guided behaviours these cells are suited to.

In order to do this, we leverage research which has described the receptive field properties of two classes of ring neuron in the \emph{Drosophila} ellipsoid body \cite{Seelig2013}. The two subtypes of ring neuron investigated were the R2 and R4d ring neurons, of which only 28 and 14, respectively, were responsive to visual stimuli. The cells were found to possess receptive fields (RFs) that were large, centred in the ipsilateral portion of the visual field and with forms similar to those of mammalian simple cells \cite{Hubel1962} (for details of how the receptive fields were estimated, see \emph{Materials and methods}). Like simple cells, many of these neurons showed strong orientation tuning and some were sensitive to direction of motion of the stimuli. The ring neuron RFs, however, are much coarser than simple cells, far larger and less evenly distributed across the visual field and respond mainly to orientations near the vertical. This suggests that ring neurons might have a less general function than simple cells \cite{Wystrach2014}. In mammals, the very large population of simple cells means that small, high-contrast boundaries of any orientation are detected at all points in the visual field. Thus the encoding provided by simple cells preserves visual information and acts as a `general purpose' perceptual network, that can feed into a large number of behaviours. In contrast, the coarseness of the receptive fields of ring neurons, allied to the tight relationship between specific behaviours and specific subpopulations of ring neurons suggests instead that these cells are providing economical visual information that is likely tuned for specific behaviours \cite{Wystrach2014}.

To investigate such issues, we use a synthetic approach whereby investigations, in simulation, of the information provided by these populations of neurons can be related to behavioural requirements, thus `closing the loop' between brain and behaviour. We show how the population code is well-suited to the spontaneous bar orientation behaviours shown by flies. Similarly, we verify that our population of simulated ring neurons are able to explain the success and failure of the fly to discriminate pairs of patterns. Upon deeper analysis, we demonstrate that certain shape parameters -- orientation, size and position -- are implicit in the ring neurons' outputs to a high accuracy, thus providing the information required for a suite of basic fly behaviours. This contrasts with the rather limited ability of ring neuron populations (and flies) to discriminate between abstract shapes, casting doubt on cognitive explanations of fly behaviour in pattern discrimination assays.

\section*{Results}
Here we analyse the task-specific information provided by visually responsive ring neurons by simulating their responses during well-known behavioural experiments  To do this we use data from \cite{Seelig2013} who used calcium imaging to examine the receptive fields (RFs) of ring neurons whose cell bodies are in specific glomeruli in the lateral triangle. As the RFs of glomeruli are remarkably consistent across flies \cite{Seelig2013}, we combine them to reduce measurement error and obtain sets of ‘canonical’ RFs, which can be thought of as visual filters. Though this averaging process will produce RFs that are more regular than those reported for individual flies, we feel this process is better than using RFs from a specific fly as, firstly, some of the irregularity in the RFs presumably derives from measurement error, and secondly, it is unlikely that smoother edges on the RFs give an ‘unfair advantage’ in the tasks we examine. This process (for details, see \emph{Materials and methods}) gave us a set of 28 R2 and 14 R4d filters (14 and 7 on each side, respectively). To investigate the information these cells encode, we calculate outputs for a given visual stimulus by convolving it with the averaged ring neuron filters. This gives a population code whereby the outputs of the set of filters is the encoded ‘representation’ of the current visual stimulus. We interrogate these encodings to understand the information they contain, focusing on the relationships to specific behaviours.

\subsection*{Orientation towards bar stimuli}
We first consider experiments in which flies are presented with bar stimuli as flies are known to spontaneously orient towards black bars \cite{Gotz1987}, aiming for the centres of narrow bars and the edges of wide bars \cite{Osorio1990}. We thus examine the response of simulated ring neurons to bars of different widths (Figure~\ref{fig:recap}A and B). The summed output of the ensembles of ring neurons show peaks to the bars of different widths which broadly match experimental results (Figure~\ref{fig:recap}B). For instance, R2 neurons respond maximally to the inside edges of large bars, while peak activity in R4d neurons occurs at bar centres and also at roughly $\pm 90\degree$. While we do not know the details of mechanisms downstream of the ring neurons and hence how their activity is transformed into action, the simulation is an existence proof that the information needed to control the observed behaviour is present in the sparse ring neuron code. 
We further demonstrate this point by closing the loop between sensory systems and behaviour using a simple model of a fly viewing a bar in which the fly’s heading is controlled by the difference between the summed activation of left and right ring neurons (Figure~\ref{fig:recap}C; see \emph{Materials and methods} for details). The simulated fly approaches the bar from different distances, demonstrating centre-aiming when far from the bar and fixation of the edges when nearer and the bar’s apparent size is greater (Figure~\ref{fig:recap}D). Through this example, we can see how the information present in this small population of visually responsive ring neurons can control a specific behaviour. We now turn to a more complex behaviour, pattern discrimination. 

\subsection*{Pattern discrimination in flies and ring neuron population codes}
The standard paradigm for testing pattern discrimination in \emph{Drosophila} \cite{Pan2009,Liu2006,Ernst1999,Dill1993}, involves tethering a fly in a drum with a pair of alternating patterns on the inside wall of the drum (Figure~\ref{fig:recap}A). When the fly attempts to rotate about the yaw-axis, the pattern on the drum is rotated by a corresponding amount in the opposite direction, giving closed-loop control. Conditioning is aversive and orientation towards a quadrant containing one of the patterns of the pair is punished with heat from a laser. Hence, if the fly can discriminate the patterns, it will learn to orient towards the non-punished pattern. The ability to discriminate patterns in such an assay requires R2 neurons, specifically synaptic plasticity afforded by \emph{rutabaga} in these neurons is sufficient and necessary for observed pattern learning \cite{Pan2009,Wang2008,Liu2006,Ernst1999}. We therefore investigate the responses of ring neurons in simulations of the classic pattern discrimination paradigm.

To recreate the visual information perceived by flies in such experiments, we simulated a typical experimental flight arena with a fly tethered in the centre. We then examined the output of the ensembles of ring neurons for a fly rotating in the drum and looked at the difference in the activation code when facing the different patterns of a pair. Our logic is that if the ensemble codes were identical, it would be impossible for the patterns to be discriminated by interrogating the outputs of ring neurons alone. Similarly, the greater the difference in the ring neuron ensemble activation codes when looking at the pattern pairs, the easier they would be to discriminate (Figure~\ref{fig:recap}F and G, see \emph{Materials and methods} for details). Our discriminability measure is the root mean square (r.m.s.) difference between ensemble outputs when the fly faces different azimuths in the drum. As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:recap}, we can compare the ensemble output for a simulated fly oriented at 0\degree\ (i.e. view centred on one pattern) and the ensemble output for a ‘fly’ at other azimuths. The \ac{rms} difference, as compared to the view at 0\degree, rises as the fly rotates in the drum, peaking as it faces the space in between the patterns and dropping to a minimum when facing the centre of the next pattern (Figure~\ref{fig:recap}F and G). For some pairs of patterns, there is still an appreciable r.m.s. difference between the codes when facing the centres of each pattern, thus enabling their discrimination. However, in the example of Figure~\ref{fig:recap}F, if we displace the patterns vertically, we see a drop in the r.m.s. difference between activation codes for when the fly fixates the patterns. This is despite the fact that to the human eye, the patterns still appear very different. Interestingly, the second pattern-pair is also harder to discriminate for flies.

In this way, we can use the difference between ensemble codes when flies face the patterns to re-examine the discriminability of pattern pairs tested with flies. One illustrative example is Set~\emph{(9)} from \ref{fig:pattern}, which contains pairs of ‘triangles’ (either a filled equilateral triangle, or a long and short bar arranged on top of one another), one facing up and the other down. Flies are able to discriminate these pattern pairs when they are aligned along the top and bottom, but not when aligned about the vertical centres of mass\cite{Ernst1999}. Looking at the placement and form of the R2 RFs allows us to determine where this difference comes from (Figure~\ref{fig:simdiffpatts}). The excitatory regions of the RFs fall roughly across the middle of triangles that are not aligned about their vertical centre of mass the difference in width at this point will lead to differences in activation. If the triangles are offset (Figure~\ref{fig:simdiffpatts}) so as to be aligned about their vertical centres of mass their width will be similar for the regions of peak R2 coverage and the difference in activation will be lower. Thus the failure to be able to discriminate features with an equivalent vertical centre of mass can be explained by the shape of the RFs interacting with the patterns directly. It is not necessary to invoke an additional system that extracts and compares the vertical centres of mass of the patterns.

Similarly, Set~\emph{(2)} in Figure~\ref{fig:pattern} gives examples of pattern pairs that are not discriminable by flies and also give only small differences in the outputs of R2 filters. This may seem surprising, given that these patterns appear quite different to human observers and are also very dissimilar if compared retinotopically. Thus we can see how the \emph{Drosophila} R2 ring neuron encoding is informationally sparse. Whilst the human V1 region of human visual cortex contains neurons representing a full range of orientations all across the visual field, R2 neurons have large RFs and poor orientation resolution. Hence, a pattern pair consisting of a diagonal line facing left and a diagonal line facing right, for example, have only a small difference in R2 outputs in our simulation and are also not discriminable by flies. This could, in the light of behavioural experiments alone, be interpreted as evidence that flies do not discriminate patterns on the basis of orientation. A more parsimonious explanation, however, is that the flies are failing because the form of the RFs means that the output code is similar for these particular orientations.

To emphasise the independence of apparent similarity of patterns and the visual encoding from R2 cells, we designed shape pairs (see \emph{Materials and methods}) that appear similar to humans, but are easily discriminable by the R2 population (Figure~\ref{fig:simdiffpatts}D and white bars in \ref{fig:simdiffpatts}F), as well as shape pairs that are considered similar by the R2 population but not by human observers (or in terms of retinal overlap; Figure~\ref{fig:simdiffpatts}E and black bars in \ref{fig:simdiffpatts}F). Despite the similarity between the pairs of patterns, the first is readily discriminable, especially from the outputs of glomeruli 1, 3, 5 and 11, while the second pair – which we easily see as having a different orientation – have very low overall differences throughout the glomeruli. This shows that counterintuitive results can arise from the irregular RF shapes. The small population of visually responsive R2 neurons can be though of as a sensory bottleneck. If the information that passes through this bottleneck is all that a fly has available for pattern discrimination, then we should see a close relationship between the r.m.s. difference in simulated R2 output for a pattern pair and the flies’ ability to learn to discriminate that pair. We thus examined the difference in the outputs of the R2 filters between patterns from pairs drawn from \cite{Ernst1999} (Figure~\ref{fig:pattern}). In general, the pattern pairs for which flies show a significant learned discrimination have a greater r.m.s. difference in R2 population activity \cite{Ernst1999}. All of the pattern pairs where flies show significant learning ($n = 8$) have R2 r.m.s. differences above the overall mean (Figure~\ref{fig:pattern}A and B), whereas 13 out of 18 patterns that flies found more difficult to learn had below-mean r.m.s. differences. (There were nine pattern pairs for which a learning significance level was not given that were excluded.) Across all pattern pairs, we find a significant correlation between the strength of the learning index reported for flies in \cite{Ernst1999} and the r.m.s. difference in R2 activation (Spearman’s rank, $n = 30, \rho = .420, p < .05$). Of course, these differences could simply result from the appearance of the patterns. Therefore, as a control comparison, we quantified the similarity of patterns within a pair based on the degree to which the patterns overlap in a pixel-by-pixel manner (see \emph{Materials and methods}). There was no significant correlation with the flies’ learning index over the pattern pairs (Spearman’s rank, $n = 32, \rho = -.068, p = \mathrm{n.s.}$). We additionally looked at the relationship between the two visual similarity metrics (R2 population code and pixelwise retinal overlap) and the degree to which flies show a spontaneous preference (i.e. before any conditioning procedures have commenced) for one of the patterns within a pair (Figure~\ref{fig:pattern}D and E). There was no correlation for R2 population codes (Spearman's rank, $n = 29, \rho = .289, p = \mathrm{n.s.}$), but for retinal overlap there was a weakly significant correlation (Spearman's rank, $n = 29, \rho = -.371, p < .05$). This is in keeping with research showing that R2 neurons alone are critical for learned pattern differences \cite{Ernst1999}, but not spontaneous preferences which, by contrast, seem to result from activity across all subsets of ring neurons {\bf [amend?]} \cite{Solanki2015}.

There are, however, some discrepancies where the learning performance of flies for a particular pattern pair does not match the r.m.s. difference of our R2 population code. In some cases flies are better at discriminating pairs of patterns that discriminate along the vertical rather than horizontal axis (Set~\emph{(3)} vs Set~\emph{(4)}, and the pairs in Set~\emph{(12)}, marked with red Xs in Figure~\ref{fig:pattern}). In contrast, the r.m.s. difference in the R2 population code discriminates horizontal and vertical patterns equally. This is because our R2 filters are being presented with static stimulus pairs to simulate a fly oriented towards the centre of a pattern, for flies the patterns were moving horizontally but fixed in the vertical axis (as noted in \cite{Ernst1999}) making it harder for flies to resolve horizontal information.

Overall, we have shown that the behavioural performance of flies on a pattern discrimination task is approximated by a simple similarity metric applied to the population activity of a small number of simulated R2 cells. However, it is curious that both flies and the population of simulated R2 cells are bad at a variety of seemingly simple pattern discriminations which raises the question of why evolution has not optimised the visual system for this task. A simple thought experiment is helpful in considering the purpose of the visual code provided by the R2 neurons. If we double the number of R2 neurons in our population by inserting additional RFs of the same forms at random points on the visual field, then the r.m.s. difference for centre of mass-aligned triangles increases to levels similar to those for pattern pairs easily discriminated by flies (data not shown). We can therefore see how the pattern discrimination ability of an R2-like neuronal population could easily have been improved over evolutionary time without the need for any radical architectural changes. We therefore propose that there must be little selection pressure specifically for a specialised pattern recognition module in flies.

\subsection*{What information is preserved in this simple neural code?}
Having a small number of cells that provide a visual encoding of a complex scene is a sensory bottleneck with information from 3000 ommatidia condensed onto 28 R2 or 14 R4d ring neurons. We have shown that this code provides sufficient information to discriminate some pattern pairs, but that, as performance could be improved with the addition of more ring neurons, general purpose pattern recognition seems unlikely to be the purpose of the ring neuron system. The question thus arises as to what information this system is tuned to extract. Examining the pattern pairs which flies and the R2 population were able to discriminate we see that certain pattern parameters are implicitly coded for in the R2 population. Sets~\emph{(6)} and \emph{(9)} (Figure~\ref{fig:pattern}) suggest that, for instance, shape size and vertical centre of mass may be parameters that can be recovered from the R2 population code after this sensory bottleneck.

Here we address in more general terms the question of what shape information is implicitly conveyed in the ring neuron population code. To do this, we generated large sets of ellipse-like ‘blobs’  that varied in size (specified by major-axis length), position (azimuth and elevation) and orientation. The blob generation procedure was stochastic so that the precise shape of each blob was random and unique (see \emph{Materials and methods}). We then trained an artificial neural network (ANN) to recover this shape information from either a raw image of the shape (a control condition) or from the output of the R2/R4d populations that had been shown the blobs. Here we use ANNs as statistical engines interrogating the output of the ring neuron population code to determine if shape information is implicit to the code and has therefore made it through the sensory bottleneck. We first examined whether ANNs could be trained to extract positional information (elevation and azimuth) of randomly-generated blobs with orientation, $\theta$, and major-axis length, a, held constant ($\theta=0\degree, a = 30\degree$). There were 100 possible azimuths and 100 possible elevations, giving a total of 10,000 stimuli. Of these, 4000 were used for training and 6000 for testing. Performance on the test set (Figure~\ref{fig:elazorsi}) shows that ANNs are indeed able to extract information about elevation and azimuth based on any of the input types (raw, R2 or R4d). Performance was better with parameter values near the middle. At the extremes, portions of the stimuli lay outside the visual field of the simulated fly meaning stimuli begin to disappear ‘off the edge’ of the visual field (Figure~\ref{fig:elazorsi}A and B), making the task harder (i.e., is it a large object projecting outside the visual field, or a smaller object within it?). While performance was best when raw views were input (Figure~\ref{fig:elazorsi}C and D), position information could still be reliably extracted from ring neuron outputs. The R2 code performs better than the R4d and the addition of R4d RFs to the R2 code, while adding dimensionality, does not improve performance, suggesting that either an R2-like encoding is sufficient to extract positional information, or that the information in the two codes is redundant. Thus small populations of ring neurons retain positional information.

We next trained ANNs to decode information about shape orientation and size. The stimuli were again randomly generated blobs at different positions but this time ten different orientations and sizes were used, giving a total of 1000 stimuli, of which 400 were used for training and 600 for testing. The ANNs were again able to extract this shape information from raw images and the ring neuron outputs (Figure~\ref{fig:elazorsi}E--H). Orientation was the parameter with the highest error score, possibly because its calculation necessitates using a second-order statistic (the covariance of the shape). Nonetheless, both parameters could be simultaneously estimated by an ANN neural network fed with ring neuron outputs. 
In summary, we have shown that information about a number of shape properties passes through the bottleneck created by the small number of ring neurons. This indicates that such information is available downstream of the ring neurons for the guidance of behaviour.

\section*{Discussion}
A general problem in neuroscience is understanding how sensory systems organise information to be at the service of behaviour. Computational approaches can be important in this endeavour, as they allow simulation of the sensory experience of a behaving animal, meaning that one can investigate how this information is transformed by populations of neurons into behaviour. In this way, we can relate the details of neural circuitry to theories about the requirements of behaviour. Work by Seelig and Jayaraman \cite{Seelig2013}, showing the forms of visual receptive fields for ring neurons projecting to the ellipsoid body of flies, gave us the opportunity to investigate how these neurons transform information and how this information relates to specific behaviours. In particular, we have shown that despite the small size of the code, the outputs of the ring neurons could subserve both bar following and limited pattern recognition and also implicitly convey information about shape parameters. We now discuss the implications of our findings.

\subsection*{Short-term memory for object position in flies}
One striking feature of the ring neuron receptive fields is that they are in general tuned to vertically oriented objects. We know that fruit flies are strongly attracted to vertical bars, a finding that has been leveraged across a range of behavioural paradigms (e.g. bar fixation: \cite{Neuser2008}). In one, single flies are placed into a virtual-reality arena, with two vertical stripes shown 180\degree\ apart. In this scenario, flies typically head back and forth between the two bars. Occasionally, when a fly crosses the arena’s midline, the bars disappear and a new bar is presented at 90\degree\ to the originals, to which the flies reorient. The new target then also disappears, and the flies resume their initial heading, even though the original bars are no longer visible. This indicates that directional information is stored in short-term memory and updated. Work by Neuser and colleagues \cite{Neuser2008} has shown that R4 (and R3) ring neurons are involved in this spatial orientation memory. We found that both R2 and R4d neurons were responsive to vertical bars of varying widths, mimicking flies' preference for the edges of larger bars and the centres of narrower ones \cite{Osorio1990}. We also showed that the cells provide sufficient information to guide homing towards a large vertical object and, separately, that the azimuth of bar stimuli makes it through the sensory bottleneck, which confirms a viable role for R4d in the behaviour described above.

Something not considered here is the effect of learning on the directional neural code.
Yet, we know that it must play a role, as the response to R4d neurons to landmarks at the same heading differs between trials \cite{Seelig2015}.
Recently, Cope and colleagues \cite{Cope2017} have created an interesting model of this process, which works by mapping portions of the visual field to a ring attractor network with Hebbian learning.
This could help pave the way towards a deeper understanding of how learning processes direct the way in which sensory inputs inform behaviour.

The more general role of R4d cells within the central complex is still unknown.
There is evidence that R4d neurons are able to act as a ring attractor, maintaining a stable encoding of the fly's orientation with respect to a landmark \cite{Seelig2015}.
Therefore, R4d neurons could be conceived variously as functioning like mammalian head-direction cells \cite{Tomchik2008}, playing a part in a path integration system \cite{Neuser2008} or in conditioning of visual orientation \cite{Guo2015}, perhaps serving several functions simultaneously.
These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, of course, and their true function will become apparent only with a better understanding of the behaviours in which they are involved.

\subsection*{Are flies performing pattern recognition?}
\emph{Drosophila} can discriminate patterns differing in size, orientation and elevation, an ability for which R2 cells are critical \cite{Ernst1999,Liu2006,Pan2009}.
We have shown that the discriminability of a given pattern pair is predicted by the outputs of the R2 RFs, despite their not encoding higher-order visual properties explicitly, a finding consistent with neurophysiological work \cite{Liu2006}.
Any selection pressure on flies’ ability to discriminate patterns (as bees need to do, for instance) would surely have led to a larger R2 population or, possibly, visual input to the mushroom body \cite{Ehmer2002,Wolf1998}, and we can therefore be confident that ring neurons have not been tuned for arbitrary pattern recognition.
Accordingly, we suggest caution if research on flies is used with the aim of understanding the neural basis of pattern recognition or visual cognition \cite{Menzel2001}.

It is interesting to consider to what extent \emph{Drosophila}'s ecological needs are served by general learning mechanisms -- such as a capacity to learn arbitrary visual stimuli -- and to what extent by domain-specific abilities.
For example, bees have a well-attested ability to learn many varied patterns, which presumably derives from a need to learn flowers \cite{Gould1985}; it is not apparent, however, that there has been a comparable selection pressure on \emph{Drosophila} for such a general-purpose learning ability.
Indeed, in many cases, a task-specific heuristic can provide an elegant solution.
For example, male fiddler crabs (\emph{Uca pugilator}) treat every salient object above the horizon as a predator and everything below as a conspecific \cite{Layne1997}, greatly simplifying this discrimination task.
Similarly, \emph{Drosophila} have a mechanism to approach bars and to avoid small objects \cite{Maimon2008}; presumably to approach vegetation (for oviposition, etc.) and avoid predators, respectively.
In order to fully understand these circuits we need to examine further how flies depend on a balance of innate visual responses versus learned visual information.

So, if the R2s are not truly `pattern-recognition cells', the question remains: what are they for?
Though we have not attempted to answer this question here, we have shown that there is \emph{implicit} information about higher-order properties, such as stimulus position, in the RFs' code, which could drive any number of natural behaviours.
For example, elsewhere we have shown that the information content of ring neuron RFs is suitable for place learning and homing \cite{Dewar2015,Ofstad2011}, and although this involves R1 ring neurons, not R2, it gives an indication of how such sensory information can be used.
However, a set of neurons can serve diverse functions, making the story more complex: in particular, different subsets of R2 neurons have also been implicated in an olfactory decision task \cite{Azanchi2013} and in sleep drive \cite{Liu2016}.

One of the advantages of studying insects is the potential for describing their neural processes with modelling.
In this way, simulations can help bridge the gap between biology and behaviour \cite{Webb2009}.
We thus hope that future experiments, grounded in both the ecological needs of the animal and the information given by neural circuits, will be able to better inform the next generation of models, and vice versa.

\section*{Materials and methods}
\subsection*{Neurogenetic methods used for estimating ring neuron receptive fields}
\label{sec:methods:seelig}
The goal of Seelig and Jayaraman's \cite{Seelig2013} work was to examine responses of lateral triangle microglomeruli (which house the cell bodies of the ring neurons) to visual stimuli.
For this, they employed two-photon calcium imaging to examine the activity of genetically targeted subsets of microglomeruli, the R2 and R3/R4d neurons.
Fluorescence was recorded for head-fixed flies held in an arena with a curved display composed of an LED array.
In order to map the receptive fields, the flies were presented with a series of flashing dots at random locations on the visual display; the fine structure of the receptive fields (RFs) was then revealed by using white-noise stimuli \cite{Weber2010}.
The accuracy of the estimated receptive fields was then verified by correlating predicted with actual responses to novel bar stimuli (and a high degree of correspondence, was found).

\subsection*{Turning visual receptive field data into visual filters}
\label{sec:methods:preprocessing}
To create the visual filters which represent RFs, we first extract the image representations of the RFs from \cite{Seelig2013} (Extended Data Figure 8); this gives us images of $112\times 252$ pixels for R2 neurons and $88\times 198$ pixels for R4d.
Given the visual field is taken as $120\degree\times 270\degree$, this corresponds to a resolution of 1.07\degree\ and 1.36\degree\ per pixel, respectively.
As data is given for multiple flies, we averaged the RFs for the different glomeruli across flies ($2\le N(\mathrm{R2}) \le 6, 4\le N(\mathrm{R4})\le 7$). This process is summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:avkernels}. Each point on the image was assigned a value ranging from --1 for maximum inhibition to 1 for maximum excitation, based on the values given by the colour scale bars in \cite{Seelig2013}.
These images were then thresholded to give a kernel $g(i,j)$:
$$
g(i,j) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
1 & \mbox{for } R_{i,j} \ge T; \\
-1 & \mbox{for } R_{i,j} \le -T; \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
where $g(i,j)$ is the ($i,j$)th pixel of the kernel, $R_{i,j}$ is the ($i,j$)th value of the processed receptive field image and $T$ is the threshold value, here $0.25$ (Figure~\ref{fig:avkernels}A).

We took the centroid of the largest excitatory region as the `centre' of each of the kernels.
The excitatory regions were then extracted using \Matlab's \texttt{bwlabeln} function (with eight-connectivity) and the centroid, $(x,y)$, with the \texttt{regionprops} function.
The mean centroid, $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$, across flies is then calculated and the kernels are recentred on this point:
$$
\hat{g}(i,j) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} g(i+y-\bar{y},j+x-\bar{x}) & \mbox{for } 1\le i+y-\bar{y}\le m \mbox{ and } 1\le j+x-\bar{x}\le n;\\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.} \end{array} \right.
$$
where $\hat{g}(i,j)$ is the recentred kernel (Figure~\ref{fig:avkernels}C).

We next calculate the average kernel across flies, $\bar{g}(i,j)$, and threshold again:
\begin{align*}
\bar{g}(i,j) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
-1 & \mbox{for } c \le -T; \\
1 & \mbox{for } c \ge T; \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.} 
\end{array} \right. \\
\mbox{where } c &= \frac{1}{|\mathbf{G}|}\sum\limits_{\hat{g} \in \mathbf{G}} \hat{g}(i,j)
\end{align*}
where $\mathbf{G}$ is the set of kernels being averaged and $T$ is the threshold (again: 0.25). Note that instead of thresholding then averaging the raw images, $R$, before thresholding them again, we could have averaged the raw pixel values. The reason we did not do so was to reduce noise on the raw images; tests showed a negligible difference in performance when doing the latter.

In order to calculate the activation for a given RF on presentation of an image the RF must first be resized to the same size as the image.
This is accomplished by resizing the average RF, $\bar{g}(i,j)$ (using \Matlab's \texttt{imresize} function with appropriate normalisation).
Finally, the kernel is rethresholded and the excitatory and inhibitory regions are assigned different values:
$$
K_{i,j} = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
\frac{1}{N_\mathrm{exc}}, & \mbox{for } \bar{g}(i,j) = 1; \\
-\frac{1}{N_\mathrm{inh}}, & \mbox{for } \bar{g}(i,j) = -1; \\
0, & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
where $N_\mathrm{exc}$ and $N_\mathrm{inh}$ indicate the number of excitatory and inhibitory pixels, respectively.
This method of allocating values has the result that the activation (see below) for an all-white or -black image will be zero and was chosen because we are assuming that these filters, like edge detectors, are tuned to respond to relative differences within images and not absolute values.

The activation of an average kernel, $K$, to the presentation of a greyscale image, $I$, at rotation $\theta$, is then:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:act}
\begin{array}{rl}
A(I,K,\theta) = {\sum\limits^m_{i=1} \sum\limits^n_{j=1} I_{i,j}(\theta)K_{i,j}}, &\mathrm{where\ } 0 \le I_{i,j}(\theta) \le 1
\end{array}
\end{equation}

where $I_{i,j}(\theta)$ and $K_{i,j}$ are the ($i,j$)th pixels of the image and kernel, respectively. This process is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:avkernels}A.

\subsection*{Replication of behavioural experiments}
\label{sec:methods:replication}
The equation for describing the bar fixation mechanism shown in Figure~\ref{fig:recap}C is as follows:
$$
\phi_\mathrm{turn} = \frac{\mathrm{gain}\cdot \pi}{4}\left( \sum\limits_{K\in \mathbf{G}_\mathrm{left}}\max(0,A(I,K,0\degree)) - \sum\limits_{K\in \mathbf{G}_\mathrm{right}}\max(0,A(I,K,0\degree)) \right)
$$
where $I$ is the view of the bar from the agent's current location and $\mathbf{G}_\mathrm{left}$ and $\mathbf{G}_\mathrm{right}$ are the sets of left- and right-hemispheric filters. `Gain' is a parameter to control the gain of the system, and here was set to 2.

For the pattern recognition tasks (see Figure~\ref{fig:pattern}), the difference in activation is calculated as follows:
$$
D(I) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{K\in \mathbf{G}}(A(I,K,0\degree)-A(I,K,90\degree))^2}{|\mathbf{G}|}}
$$
where $\mathbf{G}$ is the set of R2 filters, $I$ is the current pattern pair and $A(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)$ is the activation of the kernel to the pattern, as described in Equation~\ref{eq:act}.
The retinal overlap for two binary patterns, $A$ and $B$, is calculated in two steps. Firstly we measure the number of overlapping pixels between $A$ and $B$; this value is referred to as $Q$. Next the proportion of pixels which this overlap represents for $A$ and $B$ is calculated and, finally, we calculate the retinal overlap as the average of these two values:
$$
O(A,B) = \frac{Q}{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^m \sum\limits_{j=1}^n A_{i,j}} + \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^m \sum\limits_{j=1}^n B_{i,j}} \right)
$$
where $A_{i,j}$ and $B_{i,j}$ represent the $i$th, $j$th pixel of patterns $A$ and $B$, respectively.

\subsection*{Neural networks}
\label{sec:methods:neuralnetworks}
The neural networks were executed using the \texttt{Netlab} toolbox for \Matlab.
All networks were two-layer feedforward networks, with 10 hidden units and a linear activation function for the output units.
There were 100 training cycles and optimisation was performed with the scaled conjugate gradient method.

\subsubsection*{Stimuli}
\label{sec:methods:stimuli}
The stimuli used to train the networks were trained were a series of black `blobs' on a white background.
The blobs were based on ellipses with a fixed ratio between the lengths of the major and minor axes ($2:1$), with the radii modified with complex waves:
$$
r(\theta) \le \left(\frac{\cos^2 \theta}{2} + \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{a} \right)^{-1} + W(\theta), \theta \in \{0, 2\pi\}
$$
where $a$ is the length of the major axis and $W(\theta)$ is a complex wave defined as:
$$
W(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n W_i(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n A_i \sin f_i (\theta+\phi_i) 
$$
where $A_i$, $f_i$ and $\phi_i$ describe the maximum amplitude, frequency and phase shift of the wave $W_i(\theta)$, respectively.
This method for generating stimuli allows for a substantial degree of random variation between the stimuli, while not producing shapes that are so irregular as to be unlearnable by a neural network.

In these experiments, $A_i$, $f_i$ and $\phi_i$ were randomly generated and $n=2$.
$A_i$ was a random value from 0 to 1, $f_i$ were random integers from 1 to 30 and $\phi_i$ was a random value from 0 to $2\pi$.
\begin{comment}
nvar = 1000;
nwave = 2;
maxfreq = 30;
maxamp = 1;
\end{comment}

The blobs were first generated, according to the above equation, as an image of $120\times 270$ pixels.
For the `raw view' stimuli, these images were resized, using \Matlab's \texttt{imresize} function, to $2\times 14$ pixels, thus giving the same number of inputs as there are R2 filters ($n=28$).

\begin{comment}
\subsubsection*{Grading performance of neural networks}
The performance of neural networks was graded by calculating the \ac{rms} difference between the matrix of true values for the parameters with the network's output:
$$
E(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{t}) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (\mathbf{y}_i-\mathbf{t}_i)^2}{n}}
$$
where $E(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{t})$ is the mean error score, computed from the vector of outputs given by the network, $\mathbf{y}$, and the vector of true values, $\mathbf{t}$.
Hence, for a network that computed the values of all parameters accurately, a graph of the network's output \emph{vs.} the true values would give the line $y=x$ and an error score of 0 over the whole range of values.
\end{comment}

		Note that this is not intended as a descriptive model of how bar attraction in flies operates, but as an illustration of the information latent in the outputs of the ring neurons, hence why many of the `flies' in the vector plot would miss the bar.
		E: The fly is held tethered in a drum. As the fly attempts to rotate about its yaw-axis, the drum rotates in the opposite direction, thus allowing the fly to select the portion of the pattern in view.
		By monitoring the fly's heading, one can surmise whether there is a spontaneous preference for one of the patterns.
		Whether the fly can learn to head towards one pattern is tested by adding a laser that punishes the fly for facing one of the patterns.
		Shown inside the drum are the visual \acp{RF} for one pair of left- and right-hemispheric glomeruli.
		F and G: The \ac{rms} difference in output for R2 RFs as the pattern is rotated.
		The reference activities are the \ac{RF} outputs when the simulated flies are at 0\degree.
		Patterns with a greater difference in activity at 0\degree\ \emph{vs} 90\degree\ (indicated by dotted lines) should be more discriminable by flies.
		For two pairs of patterns we show that there is a much smaller difference in output when the triangles are aligned about the vertical centre of mass (F) than not (G).
		This mirrors real flies' performance on this task \cite{Ernst1999}.

		{\bf Outputs of simulated R2 cells and degree of retinal overlap for published pattern pairs.}
		Difference in R2 RF output partly predicts whether patterns are discriminable by flies, but not whether there is a spontaneous preference.
		By contrast, retinal overlap predicts whether there is a spontaneous preference, but not whether the patterns will be discriminable.
		The patterns tested here are drawn from \protect\cite{Ernst1999} and are grouped according to the figures in which they appear in that work; the corresponding figure numbers are shown in parentheses.
		All patterns for which the significance of `learning preference' ($\overline{\mathrm{DCP}}$) was given are included.
		A: Grey bars indicate that the $\overline{\mathrm{DCP}}$ for the pattern was significant ($p<.05$).
		A higher score indicates a greater \ac{rms} difference in R2 activity and thus that the pattern was more discriminable by the simulation.
		Performance on more `horizontal' patterns (e.g. \emph{(3)} and the final three patterns in \emph{(12)}) was poor in the behavioural experiments, but better in simulation.
		This is perhaps due to the horizontal motion of the patterns in training, as noted in \protect\cite{Ernst1999}.

		D and E: Scatter plots of R2 difference (the `RF Model') and retinal overlap \emph{vs} learning index ($\overline{\mathrm{DCP}}$).
