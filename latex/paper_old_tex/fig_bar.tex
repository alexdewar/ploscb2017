\caption{R2 and R4d neurons show patterns of activation that match simple orientation behaviours.
A: The responses of left- and right-hemispheric R2 and R4d \acp{RF} to black vertical bars of different widths.
R2 neurons respond maximally to the inside edges of the three largest bars, which is where flies head when presented with wide vertical bars \protect\cite{Osorio1990}.
For the R4d neurons, peaks in activation occur at the bar's centre and also at roughly $\pm 90\degree$ to it, where saccade amplitude will be greatest for an agent performing bar fixation.
B and C: Outputs of the \acp{RF} can be used to drive bar homing, as shown by the vector plot in B.
The algorithm used to generate these data is shown in C.
D: The \ac{RF} outputs also provide information about vertical bar-like objects in a natural scene.
The proportion of \acp{RF} whose activity level was greater than one SD from the mean is shown (blue: R2 neurons; green: R4d neurons).
The natural image was converted to greyscale before processing.
