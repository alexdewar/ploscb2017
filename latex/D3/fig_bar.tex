\caption{The role of R4d neurons in vertical bar fixation is predicted by simulated \ac{RF} activations.
A: The responses of left- and right-hemispheric R4d \acp{RF} to a black vertical bar (solid and dashed lines, respectively). Peaks in activation are observed when the agent is facing the bar and also at roughly $\pm 90\degree$ to it (where saccade amplitude should be greatest if performing bar fixation).
B: As A, with a wide vertical bar. The greater activation at the edges of the bars may be part of a mechanism for heading towards the edges of large bars, a behaviour observed in other species of fly \protect\cite{Osorio1990}.
C: The responses of R4d \acp{RF} to a natural image of a tree. The image was converted to greyscale before being processed as described in Section~X.
D and E: D shows the headings given by the simple controller shown in E. Note that the bar fixation mechanism in the fly will necessarily be more complex.}
