\caption{Diagram showing how average RFs are obtained.
A: The raw image (left) is thresholded so as to give excitatory and inhibitory regions of uniform intensity (right; see Section~\ref{sec:methods:preprocessing}). The `centre' is then calculated as the centroid of the largest excitatory region (+).
B: Example showing aligning for two RFs. The new centre is taken as the average of the centre of both \acp{RF}. The \acp{RF} are then shifted so that the centres are all aligned.
C: Averaging of all 14 R4d RFs, following alignment. Note that this the `left-hand' version; the `right-hand' version is its mirror.}
