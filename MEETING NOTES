[adding in Dan's thing]
the point of this paper was x, if one wanted to make more realistic then...
new para in patt recog section of discussion (talk about complexity and loosely future work):
- summary section where we talk about how the situation is more complex in flies...
-- we've used a simplified neural code (in reality more info is avail)
-- world is more complex
-- motion parallax ("complex scenes comment"): dynamic interaction bt fly and world would give extra info
-- put in context of known arch of CX
-- new Seelig paper, Green et al (Maimon), science, 2017, Turner-Evans & Jayaraman, elife, 2016/2017 -- exactly the same results (connectivity)
-- active vision (Horridge)
-- for flies, we know about brain, but not about behaviour, cf. ants
-- [depends on training method: look at aversive/appetitive conditioning?]

[new fig]
other way up
grey lines representing individual R4d outputs
- todo: examine resps of R4s to decide whether to show L+R etc.

[complex scenes comment]
STRONG argument: trying to replicate lab expts, not look at the cells by themselves
plus we have a shiny new fig...

[linearity comment]
we have added discussion of complexity

[depends on training method]
point to horz patterns
"we discuss in text"
we're trying to replicate lab expts

[original data]
we're averaging across flies anyway
small changes in accuracy wouldn't make a difference
we tried diff methods and it didn't make a lot of difference
tie to use of average filters comment
'there's sufficient averaging in the process that getting the originals would not add much'
